# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Guardrail — a cardiac monitoring platform for Triadin Knockout Syndrome (TKOS), an ultra-rare inherited heart condition (~340 patients worldwide). The system passively monitors a patient's body and environment, lets them flag symptomatic moments with one tap, and generates physician reports that make subclinical events visible.

## Commands

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
uv sync                          # install dependencies (creates .venv)
uv run python server.py          # FastAPI on port 8080, auto-creates knockout.db
uv run python -m report.pdf      # generate example PDF + JSON to report/examples/
```

### Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                      # Next.js dev server on port 3000
npm run build                    # production build
npm run lint                     # ESLint
```

### Database reset
```bash
cd backend && rm -f knockout.db && uv run python -c "from database import init_db; init_db()"
```

## Documentation

`docs/overview.md` — full project vision, the 6-layer architecture, and the three blind spots (ICD Gap, Visit Gap, Why Gap). Read this first for context.
`docs/prob_statement.md` — hackathon problem statement (Track 3: Symptom Management for rare disease).
`docs/plans/` — design documents and implementation plans for each layer.

## Architecture

**Backend:** FastAPI (Python 3.13, uv) with Peewee ORM on SQLite (`knockout.db`).
**Frontend:** Next.js 16, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4, D3.js for charts.

### API routes

`server.py` is a thin FastAPI wiring file. All routes live in domain modules:

```
/push              POST   sensor.py    – ingest Sensor Logger payloads
/stats             GET    sensor.py    – per-sensor request counts
/ws                WS     sensor.py    – live HR stream + AFib detection

/drugs             GET    drugs.py     – list registered drugs
/drugs             POST   drugs.py     – register drug (auto-lookup half-life via Grok)
/doses             GET    drugs.py     – list doses (?drug= filter)
/doses             POST   drugs.py     – log a dose
/doses/{id}        DELETE drugs.py     – delete a dose
/levels            GET    drugs.py     – current PK decay levels

/patient           GET    patient.py   – full profile + diagnoses + allergies
/patient/icd       GET    patient.py   – device, zones, episodes, shock history
/patient/icd/gap   GET    patient.py   – ICD gap boundaries (70–190 bpm)
/patient/ecg       GET    patient.py   – 14 historical ECG readings
/patient/thresholds GET   patient.py   – current static thresholds
/patient/medications GET  patient.py   – active medications with PK params
/patient/triggers  GET    patient.py   – known triggers with source/confidence

/report            GET    reports.py   – generate cardiology PDF report
```

### Database layer (`database.py`)

Two tiers of Peewee models:

**Core (drug tracking):** `Drug`, `Dose` — general drug half-life registry and dose logging with exponential decay PK computation via `get_current_levels()`.

**Layer 1 (clinical foundation):** 13 models seeded from `seed/clinical.json` on first startup — `Patient`, `PatientDiagnosis`, `PatientAllergy`, `KnownTrigger`, `Medication`, `ICDDevice`, `ICDZone`, `ICDEpisode`, `ICDShockHistory`, `ECGReading`, `StaticThreshold`, `ClinicalNote`, `SurgicalHistory`.

Seeding is idempotent — `_seed_clinical()` skips if any Patient row exists.

### Report module (`report/`)

Self-contained — no dependency on server.py or database.py. Takes a plain data dict, outputs structured JSON report + PDF. Can be tested standalone. `get_report_data()` in database.py bridges the DB to the report module's expected input format.

### Frontend hooks

State management via custom hooks, no external state library:
- `useVitals` — simulated HR/HRV based on current drug level
- `usePKData` — 48-hour medication concentration curves
- `useEpisodes` — one-tap episode capture with context snapshot

Frontend currently simulates vitals; not yet wired to backend API.

## Domain concepts

**ICD Gap:** The patient's ICD ignores arrhythmias between 70-190 bpm to prevent shock storms. Guardrail monitors this blind zone. `GET /patient/icd/gap` returns the boundaries.

**PK decay model:** `remaining = amount_mg * 0.5^(elapsed_s / half_life_s)`. Implemented in both `database.py` (backend) and `lib/simulate.ts` (frontend). Nadolol half-life = 22h; symptoms cluster during trough windows.

**Static thresholds:** Patient-specific baselines from clinical records (resting HR 70 bpm is pacemaker-set, not intrinsic). Stored in `static_thresholds` table. Dynamic baselines (rolling averages from watch data) are a future Layer 2 concern.

**AFib detection** (`heart_analyze.py`): Weighted voting across 6 HRV metrics (CV, RMSSD, pNN20, SD1/SD2, sample entropy, LF/HF). Needs >= 10 BPM samples. Broadcasts via WebSocket.

## Environment

`backend/.env` needs `XAI_API_KEY` for Grok-powered drug half-life lookup. Server starts fine without it — only `POST /drugs` auto-lookup fails.

## Test patient

All seed data is for Lily Chen (TKOS, DOB 2007-04-22). Data is parsed from real medical records records and ECG PDFs. The `report/sample_data.py` has older hardcoded data that is partially outdated (lists flecainide, wrong age/HR) — prefer `get_report_data()` for accurate values.
